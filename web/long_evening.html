<h1> A LONG EVENING WITH HOLMES </h1>
<h2> by William P. Schweickert, BSI </h2>

<p>
When the world closes in with its worries and cares <br>
And my problems and headaches are coming in pairs <br>
I just climb in my mind up those seventeen stairs <br>
<em>And spend a long evening with Holmes. </em><br>
<br>
The good Doctor greets me and motions me in <br>
Holmes grasps my hand and lays down his violin <br>
Then we sit by the fire and sip a tall gin <br>
<em>When I spend a long evening with Holmes. </em><br>
<br>
And while we're discussing his cases galore <br>
If I'm lucky there comes a loud knock on the door <br>
In stumbles a client, head splattered with gore <br>
<em>When I spend a long evening with Holmes. </em><br>
<br>
Watson binds up the client's poor face <br>
While Holmes soon extracts all the facts of the case <br>
Then off in a hansom to Brixton we race <br>
<em>When I spend a long evening with Holmes. </em><br>
<br>
The Adventure is solved, Holmes makes it all right <br>
So back to the lodgings by dawn's early light <br>
And a breakfast by Hudson to wind up the night <br>
<em>When I spend a long evening with Holmes. </em><br>
<br>
So the modern rat race can't keep me in a cage <br>
I have a passport to a far better age <br>
As close as my bookcase, as near as a page <br>
<em>I can spend a long evening with Holmes. </em><br>
</p>
