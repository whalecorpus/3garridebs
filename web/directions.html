			<h1> Directions to Garrideb Events </h1>
			<h2>Directions to Hastings Public Library (Garrideb Meetings) -- 7 Maple Avenue, Hastings-on-Hudson, NY</h2>

			<p>From New Jersey, Rockland, etc: Cross the Tappan Zee Bridge, stay to the right and take the first exit (#9) – immediately after the toll booths.  At the end of the exit, turn left onto Route 9 South.  Stay on Route 9 South.  After about 3 miles (in the center of Dobbs Ferry), you’ll have to make a right turn to stay on Route 9 South.  After about another 1.5 miles, turn right onto Warburton Avenue.  Make the first right onto North Street.  Make the first left onto Maple Avenue. The Library is just past the Police Station, on the right.  Parking:  There is angle parking on the library side of the street, before the police station.  The meters take quarters.  It costs 50 cents for 6 hours (not 50 cents per hour – 50 cents to park for 6 hours).  There is parallel parking on the other side of the street (free).  There is also a parking lot behind the police station – BUT it will probably be closed for a Farmers’ Market in November.</p>
			<p>From the North or the Northeast side of the county:   Take Route 287 toward the Tappan Zee Bridge.  Take exit 9 – the last exit before the bridge.  At the end of the exit, make a left onto White Plains Rd.  At the light, make a left onto Route 9 South.  Stay on Route 9 South. After about 3 miles (in the center of Dobbs Ferry), you’ll have to make a right turn to stay on Route 9 South.  After about another 1.5 miles, turn right onto Warburton Avenue.  Make the first right onto North Street.  Make the first left onto Maple Avenue. The Library is just past the Police Station, on the right.  Parking:  There is angle parking on the library side of the street, before the police station.  The meters take quarters.  It costs 50 cents for 6 hours (not 50 cents per hour – 50 cents to park for 6 hours).  There is parallel parking on the other side of the street (free).  There is also a parking lot behind the police station – BUT it will probably be closed for a Farmers’ Market in November.</p>
			<p>From Long Island or the Southeast side of the county:  Take the Hutchinson River Parkway to the Cross County Parkway – West (toward the Saw Mill River Pkwy).  After about 4 miles, take exit 2 to merge onto the Saw Mill River Pkwy North (toward Albany).  After about 3.5 miles, turn left onto Farragut Pkwy, which will become Farragut Avenue. About 1 mile after turning onto Farragut Pkwy, turn slight right onto Route 9, then a quick left onto Main St.  After about 2/10 of a mile, turn right onto Warburton Avenue, left onto Spring Street, right onto Maple Avenue.  The library is on the left side of Maple.</p>
			<p>Parking:  There is angle parking on the library side of the street, past the police station, which is next to the library.  The meters take quarters.  It costs 50 cents for 6 hours (not 50 cents per hour – 50 cents to park for 6 hours).  There is parallel parking on the other side of the street (free).  There is also a parking lot behind the police station – BUT it will probably be closed for a Farmers’ Market in November.</p>
			<p>Train Station:  The train station is very close to the library.  It is virtually next door.  However, the very short walk is uphill.  If you plan to come by train please call Dante at 914 693 8356 and someone will meet you - with a car if that seems appropriate.</p>
